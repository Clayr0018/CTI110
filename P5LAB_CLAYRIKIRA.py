# P5LAB â€“ Self-Checkout Change Dispenser
# This program simulates a self-checkout machine that calculates how much change
# to return to a customer using dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

import random  # Module import for generating random amount owed

# Function to break down change into denominations
